# Airbnb_Data_Analysis_NYC
Airbnb is the largest peer-to-peer exchange service for hospitality around the world. By 2018, the startup had already hosted over 300 million guests.

The Big Apple is Airbnbâ€™s largest domestic market, but under state law, it is illegal in most buildings for an apartment to be rented out for less than 30 days unless the permanent tenant is residing in the apartment at the same time.

With all that in mind, it should be interesting to analyze the data, and see how this environment can affect Airbnb's performance in New York City.
